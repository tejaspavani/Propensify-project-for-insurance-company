# Capstone Project 7: Propensify

## Introduction
This project develops a propensity model to identify how likely certain target groups of customers will respond to a marketing campaign. The model aims to provide insights into customer behavior and enhance the effectiveness of marketing strategies.

## Objective
The primary objective is to predict customer responses to marketing efforts, enabling more targeted and effective marketing strategies. The model focuses on various aspects of customer data to identify key patterns and predictors of response.

## Data Description
The project uses a dataset containing customer information such as age, profession, marital status, education, and previous marketing campaign interactions. The data includes both numerical and categorical variables and is used to train and test the propensity model.

## Methodology
- **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: Loading training and testing datasets and understanding their structure.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data, checking for missing values, outliers, and feature distribution.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring correct data types.
- **Dealing with Imbalanced Data**: Employing techniques to balance the dataset for better model reliability.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to enhance model performance.
- **Model Selection and Training**: Choosing appropriate models, splitting data, and training models.
- **Model Validation**: Validating the model's performance on unseen data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Improvement**: Fine-tuning models to optimize performance.
- **Preparing the Submission**: Predicting customer responses for the marketing campaign.
- **Model Deployment Plan**: Outlining a strategy for deploying the model in a production environment.

## Results
The model effectively identifies customer segments most likely to respond to marketing campaigns, aiding in the development of targeted marketing strategies.
